    \section{Project Vision}\label{sec:vision}

    The project aims to provide a lightweight, remotely-hosted backend for secure file storage and sharing.
    It exposes a RESTful API for Authentication, File Management, controlled and revocable sharing, using modern cryptography and token-based access to protect data in-transit and at rest.
    The goal is to enable individual users and teams to host their files with complete security guarantees.

    The emphasis is on security, file sharing, simplicity, and extensibility for Clients.
    The Back-end seeks to be a facilitator, that does zero encryption or decryption on its own, and facilitates end-to-end encryption.
    This way, no cryptography primitives ever leave the user's computer, and hence there's very little fear of interception or developer interference.

    \section{Stakeholders}\label{sec:stakeholders}

    \begin{description}
      \item[File Owners:] Users who wish to store their own files remotely.
      They hold and manage encryption keys on the client side, expect confidentiality, integrity, and reliable retrieval of their data.
      \item[Share Recipients:] Users who are granted access to files hosted on CloudWorx.
      Access is scoped and revocable; recipients must authenticate and use client-side keys to decrypt shared content.
      \item[SysAdmins/DevOps personnel:] Staff who deploy, operate, and may extend the codebase for corporate use.
      They prioritise secure defaults, clear documentation, maintainability, monitoring, and operational procedures.
      \item[User:] Standard users who act as either File Owners or Share Recipients.
      They expect a simple user experience, clear permission controls, and strong privacy guarantees.

    \section{Project Vision}\label{sec:vision}
    The project aims to provide a lightweight, remotely-hosted backend for secure file storage and sharing.
    It exposes a RESTful API for Authentication, File Management, controlled and revocable sharing,using modern cryptography and token-based access to protect data in-transit and at rest.
    The goal is to enable individual users and teams to host their files with complete security guarantees.

    The emphasis is on security, file sharing, simplicity, and extensibility for Clients.
    The Back-end seeks to be a facilitator, that does zero encryption on its own, and simply takes the data and stores it locally.
    This way, no cryptography primitives ever leave the user's computer, and hence there's very little fear of interception.
